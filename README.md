## Description
Work organizer is a simple yet effective calendar application. It is designed for a work day and for use at a glance. The multiple colors make it easy to see when it is the present time, the past time and the coming time. This way if someone needs to be able to look quickly at both what they need to be doing at that time block of the day they can do so.

## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development for work organizer was that was a work calendar easy to use at a glance. 

## User Story
As a user I wanted to be able to glace at the calendar and know what time it is at present and what meeting or activity is filling that slot. I wanted a simple working calendar. 



## Technologies Used: 

CSS, HTML, JavaScript, dayjs and jquery were all used. Bootstrap was also used. 



## Challenges 
The most notable challenge was making the colors change. Even though the “present ” class was assigned to current hour in the blockHourArray.forEach loop of the colorChanges Function the present color did not want to change.  There were too many equal signs between dataHour and currentHour Another challenge was in the memory function. I had a very had time making the taks remain in the textblock when the page was reloaded


## Successes
A major success was figuring out why the present color not changing and altering the number of equal signs. Another success was making the whole thing work. 


## Directions for Future Development

Make it so that the user can either add half hour and quarter hour points or choose to have either of both. 
Allow calendar importation. 
Set it up so that the next day and previous day can be accessed to place in furture appointments or look up past information. 
Allow change of color.
